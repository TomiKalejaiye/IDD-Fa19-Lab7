*Basic HelloYou sketch running.*

## Part B. Web Camera

**a. Compare `helloYou/server.js` and `IDD-Fa18-Lab7/pictureServer.js`. What elements had to be added or changed to enable the web camera? (Hint: It might be good to know that there is a UNIX command called `diff` that compares files.)**

**b. Include a video of your working video doorbell**

*Working basic video doorbell*

## Part C. Make it your own

**a. Find, install, and try out a node-based library and try to incorporate into your lab. Document your successes and failures (totally okay!) for your writeup. This will help others in class figure out cool new tools and capabilities.**

I modified the simple video doorbell to add a ringing sound when the button is pressed. 

**b. Upload a video of your working modified project**
